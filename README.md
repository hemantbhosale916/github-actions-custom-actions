# GitHub Actions: Custom Actions

This repo contains custom GitHub Actions I’ve built to automate DevOps workflows.

## Contents
- **action-check-licenses** — enforce license policy
- **action-docker-build** — custom Docker builder
- **action-notify-slack** — alert Slack after pipeline

## Why This Matters
Custom actions reduce boilerplate and make workflows reusable across teams.

## How to Use
Each action has its own folder with README explaining:
- Inputs / outputs
- Example workflow
